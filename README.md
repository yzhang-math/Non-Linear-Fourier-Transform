# Nonlinear Fourier Transform: Numerical Experiments

A collection of numerical experiments and implementations exploring the Nonlinear Fourier Transform (NFT) and its applications in integrable systems, signal processing, and optical communications.

## Overview

The Nonlinear Fourier Transform is a powerful mathematical tool that extends the classical Fourier transform to analyze nonlinear wave phenomena. This repository provides implementations of various NFT algorithms, numerical experiments, and educational examples to understand the theory and applications of nonlinear spectral analysis.

## Mathematical Background

The Nonlinear Fourier Transform is based on the spectral theory of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations, particularly the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NLSE):

```
i∂u/∂t + ∂²u/∂x² + 2|u|²u = 0
```
